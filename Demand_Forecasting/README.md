# Demand Forecasting for Black Plastic Products

## Overview
This project involves a demand forecasting analysis for black plastic products using historical sales data and various predictive modeling techniques. The goal is to provide accurate demand forecasts that can guide inventory management, production planning, and supply chain optimization.

## Project Files
- **`Demand_Forecasting_BlackPlastic.xlsx`**: The main Excel file containing the historical sales data, calculations, and forecasting models.

## Key Components
The Excel workbook is organized into multiple sheets, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Historical Data**:
   - This sheet contains raw historical sales data for black plastic products. The data includes various features such as sales volume, dates, and any relevant categorical variables that might affect demand.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**:
   - A section dedicated to cleaning the raw data, dealing with missing values, and preparing it for analysis. This step is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the forecasting models.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - This sheet includes visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand the underlying patterns in the sales data. Key metrics such as average sales, seasonal trends, and outliers are identified here.

4. **Forecasting Models**:
   - This sheet implements various forecasting methods such as Moving Averages, Exponential Smoothing, and Linear Regression. Each model is applied to the cleaned data to predict future demand.
   - **Model Comparison**: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This helps in selecting the most accurate model for forecasting.

5. **Final Forecast**:
   - The selected forecasting model is applied to generate final demand forecasts for the upcoming periods. This sheet summarizes the forecasted demand along with confidence intervals.

6. **Visualization**:
   - This section includes charts and graphs that visualize the historical data, the forecasting model outputs, and the final forecasts. Visual aids help in better understanding and communicating the results.

## Use Cases
- **Inventory Management**: Use the demand forecasts to optimize inventory levels, reducing stockouts and excess inventory.
- **Production Planning**: Align production schedules with the forecasted demand to ensure timely delivery of products.
- **Supply Chain Optimization**: Enhance supply chain efficiency by predicting future demand and adjusting procurement and logistics accordingly.

## How to Use
1. **Download the Excel file**: [Demand_Forecasting_BlackPlastic.xlsx](Demand_Forecasting_BlackPlastic.xlsx)
2. **Review the Historical Data**: Start by exploring the historical sales data to understand the context and any patterns in the data.
3. **Examine the EDA**: Go through the Exploratory Data Analysis sheet to see key trends and insights from the data.
4. **Evaluate Forecasting Models**: Look at the different models applied and their respective performance metrics to understand which model was selected for the final forecast.
5. **Use the Final Forecast**: Utilize the demand forecasts provided in the Final Forecast sheet for your business decisions.

## Conclusion
This project provides a structured approach to demand forecasting using Excel. The methods and models applied here can be adapted to other products or datasets, making it a versatile tool for any demand planning and forecasting needs.
